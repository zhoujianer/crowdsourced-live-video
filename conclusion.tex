 We present the architecture of a crowdsourced live video system in practice and analysis the effectiveness of the system by packet-level TCP traces. We find that controller is effective for crowdsourced live video system. Video upload process is key as it influences the video download rate and 37 \% of stall in upload process cause stalls in download flows. Different frames have different performance in video. In future we will present a mixed delivered method to deliver the video which can fit different frames' need.
