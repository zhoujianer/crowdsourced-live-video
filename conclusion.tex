We present the architecture of a crowdsourced live video system in practice and analyze the effectiveness of the system by packet-level TCP traces. Video upload process is key as it significantly impact the throughput of video download flows and 37 \% of stalls in upload flows trigger stalls in download flows. Different frames have different performance in video flows. These finding may shed light on how to construct a high-performance crowdsourced live video system.
